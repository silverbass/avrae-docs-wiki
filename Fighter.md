## Fighting Style
#### Archery
Modify your character sheet to have a +2 to hit on attack rolls with ranged weapons.

#### Defense
Modify your character sheet to have a +1 bonus to AC if they are wearing armor.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
Modify your character sheet to such that the damage dice uses the ``ro1ro2`` tag.  
*Example* ``1d12ro1ro2 + 4 [slashing]``

#### Protection
```
!alias protection embed -title "<name> uses the Protection Fighting Style!" -desc "When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield."
```
**Use With:** ``!protection``

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
Modify your character sheet to have an "Offhand Attack", and add your ability modifier to the damage on that attack.

!alias 2nd embed {{set("counter", "Second Wind")}} {{mod_cc(counter, -1, True)}} {{set("heal", vroll("1d10+"+str(level)))}} {{set_hp(min(hp, heal.total + currentHp))}} -title "<name> uses {{counter}}!" -desc "On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + {level} HP. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. *(PHB 72)*" -f "Healing Recieved|{{str(heal)}}" -f "Hit Points|{{get_hp()}} / {{hp}}" -f "{{counter}}|〇" -color <color>

## Ability Score Improvement
Modify your character sheet to increase one ability score by 2, or increase two ability scores by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat. (<---insert hyperlink to Feat page)  

## Extra Attack
When you take a turn in combat, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

You can roll multiple attacks in Avrae at once using the ``-rr #`` command.  
*Example:* ``!init attack <target> Longsword -rr 2``

If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. *(PHB 72)*" -f "{{counter}}|{{'◉'*get_cc(counter) + '〇'*(get_cc_max(counter)-get_cc(counter))}}" -color <color>
```
**Use With:** ``!indomitable``
